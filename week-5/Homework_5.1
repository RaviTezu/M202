1. Start configdb server(s) using the following command:
   mongod --configsvr --dbpath /data/configdb --port 27019

2. Start a mongos instance:
   mongos --configdb terminator:27019 --port 27099

3. Start 3 mongod instances with the following commands:
   mongod --port 27031 --dbpath=/data/db
   mongod --port 27032 --dbpath=/data/db1
   mongod --port 27033 --dbpath=/data/db2

4. Once this is done, You should have 4 mongo processes running on your machine. 

5. Now we need to set the 3 mongod instaces(3 shards) as a cluster, go to the mongos shell:
   mongos --port 27099
   mongos> db.adminCommand({addShard: "terminator:27031", "name":"shard0"})
   mongos> db.adminCommand({addShard: "terminator:27032", "name":"shard1"})
   mongos> db.adminCommand({addShard: "terminator:27033", "name":"shard2"})
   Don't sweat much what "terminator" is here, it is my host name. 

6. Before doing anything to cluster, we should stop the balancer to avoid automatic chunk migrations:
   mongos> sh.stopBalancer()
   mongos> sh.getBalancerState() //should say false here

7. Now we need to create a db m202 with presplit collection in it:
   mongos> use m202
   mongos> db.createCollection("presplit")

8. Now we need to enable sharding on m202 db and shard the Collections using the "a" as shard key:
   mongos> sh.enableSharding("m202")
   mongos> sh.shardCollection("m202.presplit",{"a":1})

9. Now you need to create chunks:
   mongos> for ( var x=0; x<25; x++ ){ db.adminCommand({ split : "m202.presplit" , middle : { a : x } }) 
   Above command will create 26 chunks on shard0 as its primary.

10. sh.status() will show you the chunks under the m202 database.

11. Inoder to move the chunks from one shard to other shard, You can use the following command:
    db.adminCommand( { moveChunk : "m202.presplit", find : {a:14}, to : "terminator:27032"}) 
    I've moved the chunks first according to the question and we need to merge these chunks here according to the ranges.

12. For merging: 
    db.adminCommand( { mergeChunks: "m202.presplit", bounds: [ { "a":0},{"a":2} ] })
    Above command will merge the a:0 --> a:1 and a:1 --> a:2 chunks. 
    So, use the above command accordingly to get the ranges as per the question and sometimes you may need to move the chunks again.
