DISASTER RECOVERY AND BACKUP:
==============================

1. In a year, what is the maximum number of days of downtime you can have and still claim >99% uptime? [3] - 4 days downtime would be 98.9% availability.

2. What are the key criteria for deciding your disaster recovery requirements?
Tolerance for data loss[T]
Tolerance for downtime[T]
Tolerance for reduced capacity[T]
Tolerance for CPU-intensive queries
Tolerance to iocane powder

3. Which of the following systems might have a low tolerance for both data loss and downtime? 
Cache in front of the system of record
Data storage for a system that need only deliver information once a month
Online ad servers[T]
A system with several redundant servers and low concern for consistency
A system using MongoDB only as an in-memory cache in front of a relational database

4. What conclusions regarding downtime and data loss should we draw in considering 2-node replica sets vs. single node deployments in MongoDB? Check all that apply. 
Chances for downtime are increased[T] - As they won't provide an HA and you have onemore node to go down. 
Chances for downtime are decreased
Chances for downtime are unaffected
Chances for data loss are increased
Chances for data loss are decreased[T]
Chances for data loss are unaffected

5. Which of the following systems might have a low tolerance for data loss, but a high tolerance for downtime?

Do I need to do backups?
How quickly can I restore?[T]
What complications are distributed systems introducing?[T]

8. What impacts might a snapshot based backup strategy have on a live system? Check all that apply.
Slower operations[T]
You will have to shut your system down to do it
