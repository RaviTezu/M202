Suppose you have a 3 member replica set with the primary in Data Center 2 (DC2) and two secondaries in Data Center 1 (DC1). You have set write concern at w=1. 

DC2: Secondary1 , Secondary2
DC1: Primary 
If w=1 Provides acknowledgment of write operations on a standalone mongod or the primary in a replica set.

Now suppose that your application makes three writes to the primary. However, before these writes have been replicated to either of the secondaries, there is a network partition that prevents communication between DC2 and DC1. The partition lasts for 10 minutes. The application producing writes is able to see all three members of the replica set during the entire network partition between DC2 and DC1. No other problems with your system arise during this period. 
Which of the following are true about the system during the period of the network partition?

The application will still be able to read data.[T] - Yes from secondaries 
The three writes to the primary before the network partition will be replicated to the secondaries when the partition ends. - These are lost
The primary in DC2 will step itself down when the partition occurs.[T] - Yes, as it cannot reach majority of the nodes.
An election will occur when the partition ends.
The two secondaries will hold an election when the partition occurs.[T] - Yes, as the majority is 2. so one of them will become Primary
The application will still be able to write while the partition is up.[T] - Yes, as on of the nodes in DC2 will be primary.
Only reads will be possible while the partition is up.
