1. Which of the following are considered part of best practices when doing rolling maintenance on a replica set? Check all that apply.

Perform maintenance on one secondary at a time.[T]
Ensure your replica set has a minimum of three data-bearing secondaries.[2 Secondaries are recommended]
Shut down a secondary and restart it without --replSet to perform maintenance.[T]

The new mongos will continue to use the same cursor seamlessly.
The cursor will be lost and an exception will be raised.[T]
The cursor will be reset, and the query will start over at the beginning of the result set when getmore is called next.
The cursor will skip one getmore call, so some documents in the result set will be skipped.
The cursor will behave as if it reached the end of the result set.
