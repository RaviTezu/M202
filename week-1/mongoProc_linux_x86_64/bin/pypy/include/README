This directory contains all the include files needed to build cpython
extensions with PyPy.  Note that these are just copies of the original headers
that are in pypy/module/cpyext/include: they are automatically copied from
there during translation.

Moreover, pypy_decl.h and pypy_macros.h are automatically generated, also
during translation.
