Following the instructions in an earlier lesson, install the MMS monitoring agent. Text instructions for installing the agent are here: http://mms.mongodb.com/help/monitoring/tutorial/set-up-mms/ - See Install_the_Monitoring_Agent.pdf doc. 

Use MongoProc to verify that you have completed this problem. The MongoProc verification script will check to ensure that you have installed the monitoring agent and have it up and running. MongoProc must be installed and running on the same machine where you installed the MMS monitoring agent.

Note: Nearly all MongoDB deployments are on Linux -- we estimate 95% or more. In this course, you will need to use Linux to complete many hands-on homework problems. We recommend that you install Ubuntu 12.04 in a virtual machine specifically for use in this course.
