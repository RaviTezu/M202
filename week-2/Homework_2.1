Under which of the following scenarios would you improve performance significantly by increasing readahead? Assume, unless the problem states otherwise, that:
- You're working with a system where your indexes and part of your working set fit in memory
- You're not constrained by write locks

Documents are often accessed in natural order sequentially[yes]
You are using a spinning disk, rather than an SSD[yes]
You very rarely access that portion of your data that is on disk
The working set is larger than memory
