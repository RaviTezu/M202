By default, which algorithm is used to determine which pages of memory are discarded by the kernel? - LRU(Least recently Used)

What offers the best performance in terms of Resident Memory? - Full data set fits into resident memory

Why would you want to pre-heat a specific subset of a MongoDB dataset? - You have not used a particular dataset, but you expect to be using that dataset in the immediate future.So, there wouldn't be any lag for users/application while accessing it. 

You don't have enough SSD's to put your full data set on them; some must go into spinning media. Which of the following should be placed on spinning media in a read heavy system? - Capped collections, oplog - because capped collections have sequential access pattern.

Which of the following is a potentially bad system configuration for MongoDB? 
NUMA System using MongoDB init scripts[Init script can handle it]
NUMA System with NUMA disabled in BIOS[No prob.]
- NUMA system running mongod manually [Answer]
non-NUMA system running mongod manually[No prob.]

Which of the following are recommended filesystems for use with MongoDB? - ext4, xfs [ext3 is supported but not recommended as it doesn't support fallocate()]

Which of the following is the recommendation for using MongoDB on NFS?
When using NFS ensure that your journal files and data files are stored on the same volume. [It is recommended to have the journal files on different storage, however this complicate backups]
- Avoid it if you can.[answer]
NFS is strongly recommended for use with MongoDB.
NFS significantly helps write performance.

Why should you allocate swap space when using MongoDB? Check all that apply.
For use by MongoDB
To keep the kernel from killing MongoDB when running short on memory[Yes] - As a consequence of OOM error
To give you as an administrator greater control over how memory is used on a system running MongoDB[Yes]

Which of the following can readahead settings effect? Check all that apply.
The efficiency of your data storage in memory[yes]
Seek times
Data locality
How often you access disk[yes]
Data access patterns

Increasing readahead will give the least increase in performance in which of the following scenarios?
Data to be read from spinning disks
Data to be read from optical storage
Data to be read from SSDs[yes] - it is recommended to have lower readahead for SSD's how low? 16sectors - 32 sectors
Sequential documents that are often accessed together
Documents that are accessed randomly

Which of the following scenarios might cause increases on the CPU usage metrics reported in the MMS hardware tab? Check all that apply.
Saturated I/O
Large counts or distincts
Complex MapReduce operations
Large in-memory sorts
Aggregation queries [All]
